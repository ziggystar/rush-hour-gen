Generating puzzles for the Rush Hour game.

Currently only does random search. Apparently this is not enough to find hard puzzles.

Here is at least one approach that works:

```
@phdthesis{servais2005finding,
  title={Finding hard initial configurations of Rush Hour with binary decision diagrams},
  author={Servais, Fr{\'e}d{\'e}ric},
  year={2005},
  school={M. Sc. thesis, Universit{\'e} libre de Bruxelles, Facult{\'e} des sciences}
}
```
